**Life of a Beekeeper**

To play, use the up, down, left, and right arrows to move your basket and collect flowers. The goal of the game is to collect all the flowers, but you must get more than the bee to win! You lose if the bee has collected more flowers than you.

All flowers must be collected to send you to the win or lose state.

If you collide with the bee, it slows you down and plays a sound.

Once you score five points, a berry appears on the screen. It gives you a powerup when the player collides with it, and you can move faster after.

The bee changes colors to match a flower when it collects it.

The player changes color when the powerup is collected.
